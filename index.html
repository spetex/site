          <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
          <p>I am currently employed as a frontend developer at a Czech event/culture guide and ticket selling company <a href="https://goout.net" target="_blank">GoOut</a>. It is an awesome product and you should probably check it out if you live in central Europe!</p>
          <p>I work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> or <a href="https://typescriptlang.org" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> in my day to day work. Mostly building web apps using mainstream frameworks like <a href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank">React</a>, <a href="https://angular.io" target="_blank">Angular</a> or <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>. I do not prefer any particular framework or library. My preference is clean, well tested code and good architecture.</p>
          <p>Outside of work I have coded projects in <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="https://rust-lang.org" target="_blank">Rust</a>, <a href="https://php.net" target="_blank">PHP</a> and most recently <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>. I like to educate myself in computer science topics and learn new computer languages. It gives me a fresh perspective on my day job.</p>
          <p>I am a proud <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank">Linux</a> operating system user. My distribution of choice is <a href="https://gentoo.org" target="_blank">Gentoo</a> which I use on my personal computer, my home <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> and a server <a href="https://1984.is" target="_blank">hosted on Iceland</a>.</p>

          <h3>Miniature Painting</h3>
          <p>Miniature painting is my go to activity in my free time after work and on weekends. I got hooked in with the hobby in February 2018 and I am there it ever since. </p>
          <p>For me as a nature of my occupation is to sit and stare into a computer screen for more than 8 hours every day. This fact is taking a toll on my posture and sight. After couple of years in this trade I got really tired of it. I have started to not carry my smartphone or practicing analog evenings from time to time. In one of those evenigs I came to a realization. I need a unplugged - no internet, no computer hobby. Preferably using my hands. I tried many things: playing the drums being one of those but not a single one quite clicked with me so I left it at that.</p>
          <p>In February 2018 I was walking the streets of Edinburgh and spotted an interesting shop. It was a Games Workshop Hobby Store. I went in and I instantly knew this is it. This is the thing I was looking for a long time. Right after I came back from my vacation in Scotland I bought my first Warhammer 40k rulebook, first model and some paints. I was extatic.</p>
          <p>Fast forward to 2020 my passion for miniature painting is slowly outgrowing my passion for computers. As I am getting older I am looking for some thing I can do to earn my money on my own. Programming and software development side projects are lacking the material aspect for me. I love to work with my hands.</p>
          <p>I have decided that I will make this hobby also my living.</p>
